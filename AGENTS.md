# AGENTS

## How to work here

- Start with a quick scan: `README.md`, `package.json`, and `src/`.
- Keep changes scoped and incremental; prefer small, reviewable edits.
- Follow existing patterns and conventions in nearby files.
- Update or add docs when behavior or workflows change.
- Add or update tests when you change behavior.

## Project map (starter)

- `src/` — application code

- `public/` — static assets

## Common commands (fill in)

- Install: `pnpm install`
- Dev: `pnpm dev`
- Build: `pnpm build`

## Notes

- Rules and plans will be added in `RULES.md` and `PLANS.md`.
